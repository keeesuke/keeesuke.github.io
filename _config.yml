description: I'm enthusiastic about all AI fields related to the evolution of intelligent robotics, such as Machine Learning, LLM, and Image Recognition. My vision is to replace human tasks with robots through automation, aiming for a world where people can live creatively and freely, reaching places unattainable by humans alone.
