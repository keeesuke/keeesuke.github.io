## Education	 			        		
- B.S., Material Science and Mechanical Engineering | The Yokohama National University (_Apr 2014 ‒ Mar 2019_)
- Exchange Program, School of Informatics | The University of Edinburgh at Scotland (_Sep 2016 ‒ May 2017_)

## Work Experience
**Sr.Engineer @ Amazon Japan, Customer Packaging Experience (CPEX) (_Nov 2019 - Feb 2021, Dec 2023 - Present_)**
- l Led the development of Multi-Modal machine learning classification model using text and image data that identifies among over ten million products without the need of additional packaging materials, resulted in $9M of material and shipping cost savings.
- l Employed genetic algorithms to compute 26 optimized box configurations from a shipping dataset of 500,000 items, contributing to a Cube Reduction equivalent to $700K by maximizing truck loading capacity.

**System Engineer @ Amazon Japan, Control Engineer (_Apr 2019 - Oct 2019, Mar 2021 - Nov 2023_)**
- Led the creation and implementation of a warehouse visualization system on a team of 4, deployed across six warehouses with 500+ users. Successfully handled 300+ troubleshooting tickets.
- Developed a tool for warehouse operations using Python, empowering on-site team to monitor the remaining unpicked items for each truck shipment time, reduced $400K in unnecessary server expenses.
- Successfully migrated the MySQL community database used in the monitoring tool to Aurora MySQL RDS, implementing AWS auto-scaling functions which has resulted in a 20% reduction in CPU traffic.

**Full time internship @ Datumix Corp., Tokyo Japan/California U.S. (_Sep 2018 - Mar 2019_)**
- Simulated the unmanned Multi-Shuttle System for warehouse loading and enhanced the efficiency of shipping order for multi-order items by applying reinforcement learning.

## Projects
### Box Optimization with Genetic Algorithm to find Best Fitted Box Suite
[Full Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Box Optimization Project aimed at reducing and optimizing box types used in Amazon Fulfillment Centers to improve shipment efficiency. There are currently 400 box types managed across centers, with many rarely used boxes and redundant similar sizes complicating inventory and data management. The Box Consolidation Approach will align box suites by Fulfillment Center type, consolidate rarely used boxes, halt rarely used box production, and optimize air ratio; it is initially being implemented across all Sortable Centers where it is expected to reduce cube per shipment by 3.2% and lead to $770,000 in annual savings. The consolidation approach employs a genetic algorithm to swiftly determine optimal box lineups specialized for each Fulfillment Center type out of the vast number of possible box combinations.

### SIOC ML Prioritized Inventory Expansion Program
[Full Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Ship in Own Container (SIOC) is a shipping type that reduces costs by shipping items without Amazon packaging. To increase SIOC shipments, our team provides a prioritized list of products to inspect if they meet SIOC standards. A machine learning model was developed to predict SIOC likelihood and prioritize inspections to maximize future SIOC shipments. The model was trained on historical data and improved over time, most recently in September 2023 using 587k data points and techniques like Word2Vec and Topic Modeling. The SIOC inventory expansion program, enabled by the ML prioritization model, is estimated to drive over 500M JPY in cost savings in 2023.
