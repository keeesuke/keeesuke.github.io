##### [Full Project Description (PDF)](/assets/img/UIUC/principal_autonomy/Autonomous_GEM_Project.pdf)

ROS 2–based autonomous driving stack deployed on the UIUC GEM e4 electric vehicle, designed to improve pedestrian safety by adapting vehicle behavior using time-to-collision risk estimation. The system integrates LiDAR- and RGB-D–based pedestrian perception, motion prediction, and a high-level decision state machine that gates safety-aware control, enabling speed adaptation under uncertainty.

### <img src="/assets/img/logo/UIUC.png" alt="UIUC" width="30" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:3px;"> Open-Vocabulary 6D Pose Estimation Using SAM3 and FoundationPose

##### [Full Project Description (PDF)](/assets/img/UIUC/computer_vision/6D_Pose_Estimation_Project.pdf)

An open-vocabulary, zero-shot 6D object pose estimation framework for robotic manipulation that enables language-guided target selection and dynamic switching in unstructured environments. Built on FoundationPose (CVPR 2024), the pipeline integrates SAM-3 for precise segmentation and a vision-language model to support text-driven object specification with on-the-fly geometric proxy generation.

### <img src="/assets/img/logo/Amazon.png" alt="Amazon" width="50" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:3px;">  Box Combinatorial Optimization with Genetic Algorithm
##### [Full Project Description](/projects_at_amazon/box_consolidation/box_consolidation)

Box Consolidation Project aimed at reducing unnecessary box types used in Amazon Fulfillment Centers to improve shipment efficiency. There were redundant 400 box types managed across FC network, complicating inventory and data management. The Box Consolidation  aligned box suites by FC type, consolidate boxes, halt less-used box production, and optimize air ratio. A Genetic Algorithm swiftly calculating optimal box lineups reduced cube per shipment by 3.2% and lead to $770,000 in annual savings.

### <img src="/assets/img/logo/Amazon.png" alt="Amazon" width="50" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:3px;"> Identify Ship-Ready Products with Machine Learning
##### [Full Project Description](/projects_at_amazon/SIOC_ML/sioc-text-ml-project)

Ship in Own Container (SIOC) is a shipping type that reduces costs by shipping items without additional Amazon packaging, hence reducing supply/transportation costs through decreased shipped volume. Developed a machine learning model to predict SIOC likelihood and prioritize inspections to maximize future SIOC shipments. The model was trained on historical data, using 587k data points, resulted in $600K in cost savings anually.

### <img src="/assets/img/logo/Amazon.png" alt="Amazon" width="50" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:3px;"> 3-Dimensional Box Size Optimization
##### [Full Project Description](/projects_at_amazon/box_opt_VDB/box_opt_VDB)

Variable Depth Box (VDB) is a packaging solution designed to adjust its height based on the size of the product, reducing air space and minimizing packaging material waste. I optimized the 3-dimensions of VDB sizes with Simulated Annealing, demonstrated a 2.16% improvement in the air ratio, based on the annual shipment record.

### <img src="/assets/img/logo/Amazon.png" alt="Amazon" width="50" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:3px;"> Monitoring System Deployment
##### [Full Project Description](/projects_at_amazon/monitoring_system/monitoring_system)

Seiren is an in-house visualization system by Amazon Japan for monitoring Fulfillment Center equipment. It provides real-time data on operational status, productivity, and errors, extracted from PLCs controlling warehouse conveyors. The system minimizes delays in identifying issues, preventing operational process halts and delivery risks. Over 2 years, I led end-to-end from system design to deployment and subsequent maintenance as a program manager, successfully deployed across 6 new FCs.

### <img src="/assets/img/logo/Amazon.png" alt="Amazon" width="50" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:3px;"> Similar Product Recommendation Tool
##### [Full Project Description](/projects_at_amazon/Word_Similarity_Tool/word_similarity_tool)

The Similar Product Recommendation Tool is designed to streamline the identification of incorrectly annotated products (e.g., items marked as liquid/fragile but not meeting such criteria), mitigating risks for damaged items. It leverages TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to accurately match input keywords with product titles or descriptions, reducing manual inspection efforts. The tool processes keyword searches via an AWS-backed architecture, providing results through a Python-based Flask server.
